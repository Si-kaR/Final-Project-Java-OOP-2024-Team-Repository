                            Climate Change in Nigeria

•Nigeria has a diverse climate ranging from semi-arid in the north to tropical monsoon in the south, with seasonal variations in rainfall and temperature. 

•The northern regions experience hot, dry conditions with high temperatures reaching up to 44°C, while the southern coastal areas receive heavy rainfall of around 4,000 millimeters annually. 

•Climate change is causing shifts in these climatic zones, with the desert region in the north receding northwards, the savanna climate expanding, and the tropical monsoon regions moving northwards. 

•Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and an increase in extreme weather events like droughts, floods, and storms are impacting various regions differently.

•Overall, Nigeria faces significant climate variability and is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change across its diverse geographical areas.
