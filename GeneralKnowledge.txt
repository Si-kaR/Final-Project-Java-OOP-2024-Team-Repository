•Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns mainly caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. 
•Since the pre-industrial era, average global temperatures have risen by around 1.2°C (2.2°F), contributing to more frequent and severe extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. 
•In 2021 alone, the United States suffered economic losses estimated at $155 billion due to such extreme weather events. 
•Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities worldwide, with projections of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) of sea level rise by the end of the century if current trends persist. 
•Mitigating climate change requires global collaborative efforts to reduce carbon emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and adopt sustainable practices across all sectors.
